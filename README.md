# 🧠 Round-1A — Adobe India Hackathon

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Connecting the Dots**  
Given a collection of PDF documents, the task is to analyze and extract semantic information from their outlines (bookmarks) to enable better content navigation and contextual understanding.

This project solves the challenge by extracting outlines from PDF files using Python, structuring them into machine-readable formats, and optionally allowing downstream processing like persona tagging or section classification.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### 🔧 Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saiyanamalamanda/Round-1A.git
cd Round-1A
````

2. (Optional) Create virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 🐳 Docker Setup

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t round1a-extractor .
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/app" round1a-extractor
```

> 📂 You can mount a volume with your PDFs and pass the filename as an argument in the run command.

## 📝 How to Use

Run the script with a PDF file:

```bash
python extract_outline.py sample.pdf
```

The script will print or save the outline structure of the PDF in a nested JSON-like format, making it easier to analyze or transform.

## 📌 Sample Output

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Chapter 1: Introduction",
    "page": 1,
    "children": [
      {
        "title": "1.1 Background",
        "page": 2
      },
      {
        "title": "1.2 Objective",
        "page": 3
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "title": "Chapter 2: Methods",
    "page": 5,
    "children": []
  }
]
```
